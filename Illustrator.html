        <h1>Adobe Illustrator: A Powerful Tool for Logo Design and Web Layouts</h1>
        <p>
            Adobe Illustrator is a versatile tool for creating vector-based designs, making it
            an excellent choice for logo creation. Unlike raster images, which are composed of
            individual pixels, vector images are defined by mathematical formulas that determine
            points, lines, and proportions. This allows them to be infinitely scaled without losing
            resolution, ensuring crisp and professional results.<br /><br />

            The three logos showcased on this page were designed using Illustrator’s powerful features.
            The <strong>Shape Builder Tool</strong> was used to combine different shapes, while 
            <strong>Type on a Path</strong> helped wrap text around the different shapes. The 
            <strong>Intertwine Tool</strong> allowed letters to weave seamlessly together, creating a 
            dynamic effect. The final logo integrates AI-generated artwork —specifically, a snail design— 
            which was then vectorized using the <strong>Trace Tool</strong>. <br /><br />

            Beyond logo creation, Adobe Illustrator is also a valuable tool for web design layouts,
            as represented in the last example. It enables designers to present visual concepts to
            clients before translating them into HTML and CSS. Among the essential tools for crafting
            layouts are <strong>guides</strong>, which aid in precise alignment, and the 
            <strong>Rectangle Tool</strong>, which facilitates structured composition. Illustrator's 
            design-first approach ensures a smooth transition from concept to code, making it an 
            indispensable asset for web designers.
